The console app takes the SDRAM dump image from KO4BB and uses NI-VISA to program an 8560E Spectrum Analyzer and its 85620A Mass Memory Module with the DLPs

You can get the image from https://www.ko4bb.com/getsimple/index.php?id=manuals&dir=HP_Agilent_Keysight/HP_85620A - <ins>Drop the .BIN file into the debug folder or the folder that the .EXE lives in</ins>

Much, much thanks to https://github.com/KIrill-ka for the code to decode the image address and data bits.
